**'username'**

This is the name of the dummy user which holds the global address book.
The username does not have to belong to a valid email account. The username
will be stored in the Roundcube database but will not be able to log into
Roundcube unless it belongs to a valid email account on your server.

To create a single global address book for everyone who access Roundcube set
this options to something like: '[global_addressbook_user]'

To create a global address book per email domain which Roundcube serves set
this options to something like: 'global_addressbook@%d'

The username can contain the following macros that will be expanded as
follows:
* %d is replaced with the domain part of the logged in user's username
* %h is replaced with the imap host (from the session info)

**'perms'**

Restrict the actions that can be performed by users in the global address book
* 0 - global address book is read only
* 1 - users can add, edit and delete contacts (full permissions)
* 2 - users can add but not edit or delete contacts
* 3 - users can add and edit but not delete contacts

**NB:** The globaladdressbook_readonly option was deprecated in version 1.9,
replaced by globaladdressbook_perms.

Always copy a contact from the global address book to another one, for example
when using drag 'n drop. Default behaviour is to move the contact.

Should contact groups be available in the global address book

**'admin'**

The admin is a user or users who will always have full read/write access even
if the address book is set to read only. The follow options are available:
* To set a single user as admin then enter their username as a string like:
  'admin@domain.com'
* If you wish give admin rights to multiple users then enter the usernames in
  an array like: ['admin1@domain.com', 'admin2@domain.com']
* You can also use regular expressions to match the admin username.
  Eg: '/^admin@/i'

**'autocomplete'**
